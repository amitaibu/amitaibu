      <p> My dad is silent as-well, and that’s the second thing I can say about
        him.
        When customers enter his coffee shop, he hardly greets them. He just
        leads
        them to a table and comes back with a kettle filled with boiling black
        coffee. He pours it into old yet clean glass cups, places the kettle on
        the
        table, takes the sugar jar that was hidden in his hand, pulls out a
        silver
        spoon from his off-color buttoned shirt and stares into the client’s
        eyes.
        Then, he puts the spoon in the jar, stacks sugar, pours into the coffee
        and
        mixes.</p>

      <p> For three decades now, people murmur there, "My god, that’s exactly -
        I
        mean
        exactly - how I like my coffee."
        The third thing about my dad is that he’s still in love with my mom,
        even
        though it’s been ages since they are together, and almost all their
        friends
        are either divorced or hate each other.
        My mom also loves him.
        When he comes back from work, he kisses her and goes to make her coffee.
        She
        puts the sugar by herself. She’s the type of people who prefers making
        it
        on
        their own.
        After that, she falls asleep on the couch, and he hugs her. Hugs and
        quiets.</p>

      <p>Me - I have a small manufacturing house of garments. I wish it was
        bigger,
        but so far it’s not very successful, mostly because people don’t
        understand
        the idea. Or maybe because my marketing is wrong. I don’t know exactly
        what,
        but something is just not working properly there.
        "No, it’s not a regular mass-production," I explain. "No, these are not
        one-off’s, neither. It’s not something in between! It’s simply something
        else. Its mass-customization."</p>

      <p> For several years now, I hear people murmuring, "My god, what is he

      <p> There is this chick that shows interest lately. Behind her there’s a
        big
        client - something that can promote my business quite significantly. She
        has
        charming eyes. That’s the first thing I said about her. She also laughs
        from
        my jokes, and it is so rare to the extent, that this is the second
        <em>and</em> third things I say about her.
        When we just met, she also didn’t understand what I was talking about.
        So
        I
        invited her to my place, the next day at 5 am - "Brush your teeth, but
        don’t
        drink any coffee", I demanded.</p>

    <div class="item">
      <p> She arrived at five fifteen with swollen eyes. "I’m a night person,"
        she
        apologized.
        I sat her on the couch and went to the kitchen to make her coffee. "Two
        sugar," she yawned.
        "Two, one - what’s the difference. It’s all the same."
        I could have kept speaking, I could have clarified my intentions, I
        could
        have explained the analogy.
        But I didn’t. I don’t know why.
        When I came back to the living room, she was already asleep on the
        couch.
        I
        placed the coffee on the table, lay down next to her, and hugged her.
        Silently.</p>
